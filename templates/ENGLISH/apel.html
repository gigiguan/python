    <p class="text-left"> Description: This course aligns to college-level rhetoric and writing curriculum and emphasizes the refinement of reading and writing skills. Students will have numerous opportunities to analyze the strategies of accomplished writers so that they can refine their ability to skillfully write using effective diction, a variety of sentence structures, illustrative detail, logical organization, and a controlling tone. Additionally, students will develop their understanding of writing as a process by composing a number of in-class and polished essays. Since there is an inherent connection between reading and writing, this AP course will also develop the ability to read critically and analyze fine nuances of meanings, as students become skilled readers with a variety of prose. Because AP English Language and Composition address the Common Core Standards for English Language Arts and Literacy (Grade 11), students will also study American literature beginning with the Colonial period and moving toward modern times.
    </p>


    <p class="text-left">Requirements: This course has been approved to meet the UC/CSU “b” or “g” requirements.</p>
